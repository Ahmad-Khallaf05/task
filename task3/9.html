        <p><u>Billions of dollars </u> are spent at sporting events, on sports teams, on sports events, as well as on
            sports-related equipment and apparel. This guide is devoted to those sports that are the largest in terms of
            monies at the professional level and as a result, not every sport is included. The primary focus is on the
            professional sports industry in the United States although there are a few instances in which the
            international aspects of the industry are mentioned. Because of the focus on professional sports, the
            Olympics and amateur events are not included.
